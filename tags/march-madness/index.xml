      <description>Now that this year’s tournament has officially come to an end, I am reflecting on how the bracket I filled out using data analysis turned out.
Overall, the model did a pretty solid job. It correctly picked 41 out of 63 total tournament games, achieving 1130 out of a possible 1920 points. That may not sound great, but with all the upsets that occurred this year, the 1130 points put the bracket in the 94th percentile and a 916,000 rank on ESPN, out of around 15 million total brackets.</description>

      <description>This is how I filled out my 2021 March Madness bracket combining my own college basketball knowledge with a model I made using data analysis. To begin, I used the programming language R and loaded up 3 useful libraries. I also set the random seed to be 1016, for my favorite number 10 and the number of my favorite NHL player, Aleksander Barkov, 16.
