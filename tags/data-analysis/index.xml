      <description>Now that this yearâ€™s tournament has officially come to an end, I am reflecting on how the bracket I filled out using data analysis turned out.
Overall, the model did a pretty solid job. It correctly picked 41 out of 63 total tournament games, achieving 1130 out of a possible 1920 points. That may not sound great, but with all the upsets that occurred this year, the 1130 points put the bracket in the 94th percentile and a 916,000 rank on ESPN, out of around 15 million total brackets.</description>
