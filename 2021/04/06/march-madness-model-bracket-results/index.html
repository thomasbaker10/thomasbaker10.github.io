<p>Now that this year’s tournament has officially come to an end, I am reflecting on how the bracket I filled out using data analysis turned out.</p>
<p>Overall, the model did a pretty solid job. It correctly picked 41 out of 63 total tournament games, achieving 1130 out of a possible 1920 points. That may not sound great, but with all the upsets that occurred this year, the 1130 points put the bracket in the 94th percentile and a 916,000 rank on ESPN, out of around 15 million total brackets. I placed in 3rd in my Advanced Sports Data Analysis class where we all created models to fill out brackets, the best finish of any bracket that didn’t choose Baylor as their champion.</p>
<p>My bracket started slow, and was doing a little above average after the first weekend of games but then heated up from the Sweet 16 to the Final Four. My model correctly predicted 6 out of the Elite 8 teams, with the only 2 misses being 11-seed UCLA and 12-seed Oregon State. The bracket also selected the Gonzaga-Baylor national championship matchup correctly, so things were going very well until the Zags were embarrassed by the Bears in the title game. If my model had picked Baylor, I would easily have placed first in class and the bracket would likely have been in the top 10,000 on ESPN, just proving again how much more weighted the late round games are in the tournament challenge.</p>
<p>I am pretty happy with how successful my model was, even despite missing out on the national champion. Gonzaga was undefeated all year long and wasn’t just winning, but had been blowing their opponents out including in the tournament itself. Thus, it is not surprising that my model rated the Zags so highly, and half of the class picked Gonzaga as their champion so it was a common miss. As I touched on earlier, March Madness lived up to its name this year with plenty of shocking upsets, so I believe the majority of times my model made errant picks, that had more to do with the result being a surprising upset that most brackets didn’t correctly pick anyways than it did with my model being wrong.</p>
<p>If I was looking toward next year’s bracket however, there are a few things I would do differently. A major change for me would be making sure that strength of schedule is factored in accurately, even if that means coming up with my own formula for it. There were some incorrect picks that I can’t look to blame crazy upsets for, such is the case for teams like BYU and San Diego State. While these teams were upset in the first round, my model had them advancing to the Sweet 16, upsetting Big 12 teams Texas and West Virginia on the way. Syracuse and UCLA were their first round opponents, both of whom did advance to the Sweet 16, but the model didn’t even come close to predicting either of those upsets. With an improved strength of schedule measure, I believe the model would not have rated BYU, San Diego State and Gonzaga as high as it did meaning a Baylor champion pick could have been possible as well as the Syracuse and UCLA upset runs.</p>
<p>To wrap it up I’ll answer the big question: could you do better on your own without the model? The short answer for me is yes; I filled out a bracket outside of class just using my own basketball knowledge from watching countless hours of games all season and researching before the tournament.I correctly picked Baylor as the champion over Gonzaga because they were one of the best teams all season and while Gonzaga was better on paper, they played a much easier schedule than Baylor. My Baylor bracket is in the 100th percentile on ESPN, has 1440 points and is ranked in the top 23,000 brackets, winning me multiple bracket pools I entered into. However, had my model bracket selected Baylor instead of Gonzaga, it would have narrowly beaten this bracket by a few picks. There were a lot of similarities between the two brackets, but it seemed in the instances when I did differ from the model, I only got around half of those correct so the model was able to keep pace.</p>
<p>My advice for next year: focus on the champion and final four. If you are able to correctly pick the title match up and 3 of the final 4 teams, you should be bound to win your bracket group. The model may mostly pick chalk, but I’d say that is much more safe than trying to call an upset that no one saw coming. Madness is in the name for a reason, so you might as well get those easy points picking the higher seeds and only differ when it gets to around the Sweet 16 and Elite 8. That’s when the difference is usually made, be it by superior knowledge, or more often: luck.</p>
